For some time now, I've been looking for a good excuse to work on a project related to radio communcation.

In this guide, ~~I finally get to do it~~ we will explore how to transmit GPS data wirelessly with the LoRa-02 module and how to visualize that data in real time on a Grafana dashboard!

Full guide [published on my blog](https://kokonatt.com/embedded/gps-live-tracking).
